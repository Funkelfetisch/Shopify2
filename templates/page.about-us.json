Picture this: he loses his friends at his first festival and what does he do? Uses his soldering and novice-at-best Arduino skills to create a laser unicorn-on-a-stick as a beacon. Pretty nifty, right? But, it was pointy and risky, and that didn't quite sit right.<\/p><p>Not one to give up, Veit moved on to a cloud-hat concept, but dancing with a bulky hat didn't cut it. He needed something easy, portable, and, of course, super cool. So, the idea struck - why not use something people carry anyway? Thatâ€™s when the NEBULITE drawstring backpack was born!<\/p><p>The journey began with a few handmade prototypes, which quickly turned into a successful Kickstarter campaign. And now, we are here with our revolutionary, customizable, eco-friendly NEBULITE back- and fanny packs, jackets, kimonos and tops bringing a spark to your festival experiences. So, welcome aboard and light up the party with NEBULITE!<\/p>"
